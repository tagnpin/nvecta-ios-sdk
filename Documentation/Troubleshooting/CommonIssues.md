## Push Notifications

### Rich Push Notification Displays Only the Title and Message Text

If your `rich push notification` is delivered as a s`tandard notification` (title and text only), it may indicate that the `Notification Service Extension` is missing or not configured correctly.
The `Notification Service Extension`, introduced in `iOS 10`, allows push notifications to include media attachments (images, audio, video), action buttons, badge counts, and delivery tracking. The `NVECTA` iOS SDK relies on this extension to enable these features.

#### Key points to check:

- Ensure that the [Notification Service Extension](../PushNotifications/NotificationServiceExtension.md) is added and configured as described in our documentation.
- Use direct `URLs` for media attachments (image, audio, or video). Do not use `URLs` that point to `HTML` pages.

<!-- ### Push Notification Not Received

### Rich Media / Notification Service Extension Not Working

### Push Notification Works on One Environment but Not Another

### Simulator vs Physical Device -->

### App Group Configuration Issues

### Rich Push Notification works, But Delivery Statistics Remain at 0

If `Rich Push notification` is displayed correctly but delivery counts in the panel remain at 0, it usually means that either:

- `App Groups` are not set up correctly, or
- The `Notification Service Extension` is not fully configured.

Both `App Groups` and the `Notification Service Extension` must be correctly implemented for `delivery tracking` to function. If any configuration step is missing or incomplete, the notification will be delivered, but the delivery event will not be recorded in the NVECTA dashboard.

## Summary

- Missing/incorrect `Notification Service Extension` → Notification shows only text and title.
- Missing/incorrect `App Groups` or `Notification Service Extension` → Rich push displays, but delivery tracking fails.
